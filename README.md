# [iCodeThis inspired](https://icodethis.com/)  

I recreated their design to the best of my ability and added some JavaScript. See [demo version here](https://veelcheck.github.io/leaderboard/).   

What JavaScript does:
* It generates the content of the table.
* It allows voting by clicking the button.
* After voting for a player:  
    - their points go up by one, 
    - the button changes colour and displays a different text,
    - further voting is disabled.  

Warning: It is not ment for small screen sizes. It looks acceptable to around 600px of width, however the layout will break completely if you go below 400px.
